# This is the default "OpenMRS ID" identifier type's UUID. For lack of a REST API to generate
# an identifier, you must run the idgen module and specify the UUID of the identifier type you 
# want to use when creating patient's here. If you want the UUID of another identifier type,
# you can list available identifier types and their UUID using the command:
# omrs.py identifiertypes

# This is the default location to be used for identifiers. You can get a list of locations
# and their UUID with the command: omrs.py locations
